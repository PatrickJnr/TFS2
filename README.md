# What is this?
My work on porting TF2 Assets to s&box [may or may not work with HL:A due to s&box shaders using "complex" and not "vr_complex" like HL:A, but no guarantees]

# Whats included?
Materials and Models

# Whats not included?
Maps, Particles, Workshop, Workshop_Partner, Sound.
Possibly other stuff, I just wanted to keep it basic.

# Aren't the guys over on Amper doing this?
Correct, but these models and materials are basically a direct port from Team Fortress 2, those guys are putting in the time and effort to make them look stunning in Source 2.

# So what are you doing?
Again, these models and materials are just a simple port from TF2 for the use of Source 2, for anyone to use. The only thing I'll be doing is making sure the model rotation is correct.
